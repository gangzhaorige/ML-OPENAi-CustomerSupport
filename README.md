# Generative AI Customer Support

## [Webpages(Web crawling)](https://github.com/gangzhaorige/ML-OPENAi-CustomerSupport/tree/main/WebCrawling)


This project uses OpenAI models, including `text-embedding-ada-002` for relatedness measurement and `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` for interpreting instructions. The latter, now the default on OpenAI API, provides versatile and contextually relevant responses.


## [Email to Customer](https://github.com/gangzhaorige/ML-OPENAi-CustomerSupport/tree/main/EmailToCustomer)

This project automates customer support for a large electronics store using OpenAI. It generates personalized email subjects and summaries, performs sentiment analysis on customer feedback, and dynamically generates appropriate email responses.
